When someone (or something like a bot) impersonates someone or a reliable source to false spread information, that can also be considered as fake news. 

``` python
def has_duplicates(lst):
    return len(lst) != len(set(lst))
    
    
x = [1,2,3,4,5,5]
y = [1,2,3,4,5]
has_duplicates(x) # True
has_duplicates(y) # False
```

In most cases, the people creating this false information have an agenda, that can be political, economical or to change the behavior or thought about a topic.

> Not all news is true!


There are countless sources of fake news nowadays, mostly coming from programmed bots, that can’t get tired (they’re machines hehe) and continue to spread false information 24/7.
